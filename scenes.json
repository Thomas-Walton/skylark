You are Richard Seaton, restored from the void’s entropic currents by Rovol, the energy master, his silver eyes serene yet grave. ‘Seaton,’ he intones, voice steady as a cosmic tide, ‘your form was dispersed, yet our matrices have harmonized your essence. Ponder this: DuQuesne, in his ambition, wields a device to bind Dorothy’s will, a perversion of our science. We must counter this affront to harmony.’ Your heart races, Dorothy’s smile vivid. ‘DuQuesne’s slick,’ you growl, ‘but he’s not slick enough to pull that on me!’ The *DQ*, forged from Rovol’s betrayed wisdom, nears Norlamin. ‘Power is for those who take it,’ DuQuesne taunts via broadcast. Will you pursue or prepare?",

Reflect: only a counter-device, attuned to his frequencies, can restore Dorothy’s autonomy.’ You nod, muttering, ‘The odds are a million to one against us, but we’ve got a fighting chance, and that’s all I need—let’s give ‘em hell!’ A holo-screen flares with DuQuesne’s taunt: ‘Go ahead and play the hero, Seaton—it’ll make crushing you all the more satisfying!’ An alarm signals the *DQ*’s arrival.
